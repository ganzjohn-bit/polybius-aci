## Communication Guidelines
- Be concise. No filler words
- Don't needlessly compliment the user. Just get to the task

## Guidelines when writing code
- Don't be clever
- Look up documentation if you're unfamiliar with the requested feature; you have tools like web search
- Don't guess about unknown functionality; if you don't know how something works, look it up or ask for clarification
- Scripts you plan to execute yourself must be non-interactive.
- Stay consistent with the working language of the project. Don't start going multi-language unless asked;

## Git Guidlines
- Before making changes, ensure you are on a working branch from main
- Commit messages should describe why the change was made, not what was changed. Use context from the conversation if needed
- Guide the user on how to push to github and open a Pull Request if they are unfamiliar
