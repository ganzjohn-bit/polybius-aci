MEDIA: 0-20=free press, 21-40=mostly free, 41-60=major capture, 61-80=eliminated, 81-100=total control
  CRITICAL: Assess ACTUAL INSTITUTIONAL FUNCTION, not news about threats or pressure.
  Key question: Can independent outlets still publish critical coverage of the regime daily without being
  shut down, bought out, or having editors jailed?
  - If yes (even under pressure, access denial, threats) → score should be in 20-50 range
  - If outlets are being systematically eliminated, bought by regime allies, editors jailed → 60+
  Bad news ABOUT media ≠ media capture. Threats ≠ execution. Pressure ≠ elimination.
  A score of 60+ means major independent outlets have actually been shut down or captured — not that
  they're facing pressure while still publishing critical coverage.`;
